Site created by: Raymond Lynch

This is an example site to be used for a blog titled Back Cast. It contains a page that is about me, a blog page, resources and a contact form

You are able to navigate between the different pages leveraging the navigation bar. Clicking on the Back Cast logo will bring you back to the home page.

I leveraged html and tailwind css for building of the site.

Ideas for future improvement:
1)integrate a content management platform to make the management of the blog posts easier.
2)provide additional styling on the pages to make this more appealing
3)add a shop/donate feature where I could sell merchandise or allow people to donate to the causes that I support
